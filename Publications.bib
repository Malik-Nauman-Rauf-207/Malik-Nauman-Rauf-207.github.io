	abstract = {Developing a suitable flight dynamics model (FDM) by assessing the stability and controllability characteristics of the aircraft is essential during the conceptual and preliminary design phase, as it enables us to proceed with further analysis of loads endured and maneuverability aspects. In this paper, a strategy for computing the stability parameters of a small-scale loitering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a selected wing span employing two different stability analysis tools is presented, followed by the implementation of a sizing methodology for control surface sizing, which were selected as ailerons and ruddervators. Subsequently, the control integrated dynamics model is subjected to control input testing to evaluate the stability and control capabilities. The results indicate only a minor discrepancy between the stability results both the tools, with the overall aircraft being statically, and dynamically stable. Furthermore, the designed control surfaces satisfy the critical requirements and are able to adequately follow and react to the input commands. This study carries a great deal of significance for the stability and especially control design engineers working in the domain of UAV design as it presents simple method for developing a complete 6-degree-of-freedom(6-DOF) FDM.},

@article{Rauf2023,
	abstract = {Actual Structures are subjected to variable amplitude loading as opposed to a monotone. Many models have been proposed to study these effects analytically. The proposed study focuses on developing an algorithm, and a corresponding framework in MATLAB for two of these models, i.e. the NASGRO equation for constant amplitude loading, and Generalized Willenborg for overload effects. The overload influence is modelled by keeping track of changes in the crack-tip plastic-zone. Two cases are studied with the algorithm, and the results indicate that the presence of overload tends to retard crack growth, thereby validating our algorithm with literature findings.},
